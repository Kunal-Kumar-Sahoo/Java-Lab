- Connect our resource with the target for which we need to take input
- Resource could be a keyboard
- Via 'NodeStream' input bits are coming from resource to target
- NodeStream requires additional processing upon the NodeStream during input
- NodeStream continuously takes input in the form of bits and additional processing actually manipulates those bits to accept int, char, etc.
- Additional processing is called 'FilterStream'
- InputStreamReader (= NodeStream); FliterStream (= BufferedReader)
